[FULL README (PDF)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sideprojectslab/HD-64/main/doc/README.pdf)

HD-64 is an RF-modulator replacement for the Commodore-64 computer which features a Full-HD 50/60Hz Micro-HDMI video+audio output. Crucially, the HD-64 is not a replacement for the VIC-II, which still needs to be mounted on the motherboard

Instead of digitizing the VIC's analog video output signal, the HD-64 "sniffs" the C64's memory bus and recreates a pixel-perfect video output by means of emulation implemented on FPGA. The reconstructed video is then upscaled to Full-HD resolution, merged with the digitized audio from the SID, and sent out as HDMI.

# 3. Contributing
The only open source portion of the HD-64 firmware is the VIC-II emulation written in VHDL, with the rest of the source code not being made available. Even so, **anyone can contribute to changes to the VIC-II emulator, build and test the results without having to access the entire codebase, nor having to set up a local build system**. Builds run directly on the SPL build server and compilation outputs are delivered back to the developers through dedicated GitHub releases. Please find the [Developer's Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sideprojectslab/HD-64/main/doc/dev_guide.pdf) for detailed information on how to contribute to the project.
